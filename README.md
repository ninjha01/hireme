The apps are cross platform, and I'm cross disciplinary! I have a deep interest in biology, and thrive in a hard science environment!

I know what it's like to wake up at 4am to dose mice - and how frustrating it can be when you don't have the right software on hand.

**Your job is to plan, execute, and communicate good science.**
Writing, deploying, and maintaing software is mine.
