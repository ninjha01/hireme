# What I Do

I am a full stack software engineer who works in cancer research.

I build [websites](https://www.depmap.org), [mobile apps](https://apps.apple.com/app/allergen-guru/id1373922308), and command line tools for research scientists.
	
# Why Hire Me?

I have a lot of empathy for experimental and computational biologists.

 - How many software engineers know what it's like to wake up a 4am to dose mice?
 - How many of them are [TripleByte certified](https://triplebyte.com/certificate/YAiPxpq)?
 - How many of those completed a Bachelor's + Master's in CS in 4 years?
 - How many of those scored in the [top 3% on the MCAT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1VQ2orZxq3gcVNvb2pJMDV4UWM/view)?

# Final Thoughts

Scientific research has enough frustrations and obstacles - using ugly, outdated, inefficient software shouldn't be one you have to deal with. 
If collecting results, analyzing data, sharing reports isn't easy, we (patients, taxpayers, and you) are poorer for it.

**Your job is to plan, execute, and communicate good science.**
Writing, deploying, and maintaing software is mine.
