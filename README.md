# What I Do

I build [mobile apps](https://apps.apple.com/app/allergen-guru/id1373922308) and [websites](https://depmap.org/portal/) for biotech/health tech companies!

![](./mast.png) AllergenGuru partners with the WHO to provide up-to-date information about allergens to food scientists. | ![](./hermes.png) Project Hermes guides and tracks post-hip replacement patients through curated physical therapy, without them having to leave their home.

The apps are cross platform and I'm cross disciplinary.

I have a deep interest in biology and thrive in a hard science environment.

I know what it's like to wake up at 4am to dose mice - and how frustrating it can be when you don't have the right software on hand.

**Your job is to plan, execute, and communicate good science.**

Writing, deploying, and maintaining software is mine.
