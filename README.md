# What I Do

I build [mobile apps](https://apps.apple.com/app/allergen-guru/id1373922308) and [websites](https://depmap.org/portal/) for biotech/health tech companies!

The apps are cross platform and I'm cross disciplinary.

I have a deep interest in biology and thrive in a hard science environment.
