# Introduction

Scientific research has enough frustrations and obstacles - using ugly, outdated, inefficient software shouldn't be one you have to deal with. 
If collecting results, analyzing data, sharing reports isn't easy, we (patients, taxpayers, and you) are poorer for it.

Your job is to plan, execute, and communicate good science. 
It isn't to write, deploy, or maintain software. That's my job.

# Who are you?

I am a software engineer who works in cancer research. 
How many software engineers know what it's like to wake up a 4am to dose mice?
Between my experience working at the bench and collaborating with researchers at the Broad Institute on the [DepMap project](https://www.depmap.org), I have built a lot of empathy for both experimentalists and computationalists.
